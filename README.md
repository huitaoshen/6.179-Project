# 6.179-Project
A demo of fully-connected neural network implemented in C++ as the final project of 6.179 at MIT. The code is dependent on [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library. 

Features:

- Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent training algorithm based on backpropagation;
- Validation set for training;
- L<sub>2</sub> regularization;
- Export/Import neural network.

Implementation of neural network is based on the reference:
